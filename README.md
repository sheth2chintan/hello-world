Hello everyone!

My name is Chintan Sheth, and I am a rising second year at the University of Virginia. 
I am interested in dual majoring in Computer Science from the College of Arts and Sciences and Commerce from the McIntire School of Commerce, concentrating in Finance and Information Technology. 
I am also interested in a minor in Psychology, but we will see how things go.
